# GameDB - Your Ultimate Game Database for Kids (Portfolio Project)

This repository hosts a front-end web application designed to display a comprehensive database of video games for kids. It serves as a portfolio project showcasing modern web development skills using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The project is planned to be deployed on GitHub Pages and will feature automated testing with Playwright in future iterations.

## Features

-   **Dynamic Game List:** Displays game information in a modern, responsive "table" format.
-   **Search Functionality:** Quickly find games by name, storyline, summary, or keywords.
-   **Filtering Options:** Filter games by genre and game mode.
-   **Sorting Capability:** Sort games by name (A-Z/Z-A) and total rating (High-Low/Low-High).
-   **Pagination:** Navigate through large datasets efficiently, showing a fixed number of games per page.
-   **Detailed View:** Click on any game item to expand and reveal more detailed information (storyline, specific age ratings, platforms, video links, websites, etc.).
-   **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.
-   **Dark Theme:** Aesthetic dark mode for a better user experience.

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML5:** For the core structure of the web pages.
-   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive UI development.
-   **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** For all dynamic functionalities, including data fetching, rendering, search, filter, sort, and pagination logic.
-   **Node.js & npm:** Used for dependency management and running the Tailwind CSS build process.

## Data Source

Game data is sourced from a static JSON file (`data/dummy_games.json`) within the project. In a real-world scenario, this data would be periodically updated from an external API (e.g., IGDB API) using a backend script to avoid API rate limits and expose API keys.

## Setup and Running Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/game-db-portfolio.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/game-db-portfolio.git)
    cd game-db-portfolio
    ```
    *(Note: Replace `https://github.com/YourUsername/game-db-portfolio.git` with the actual URL if you push it to your GitHub account.)*

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start Tailwind CSS compilation in watch mode:**
    This command will watch for changes in your HTML and JS files and recompile the CSS automatically. Keep this terminal window open while developing.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

4.  **Open the application:**
    Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser, or use a tool like VS Code's "Live Server" extension for a better development experience with live reloading.

## Future Enhancements

-   Full integration with actual game data from IGDB API (via a backend script for data update).
-   More advanced filtering options (e.g., by platform, release year).
-   Enhanced UI/UX for detailed game view (e.g., carousel for screenshots, video player).
-   Accessibility improvements.
-   **Automated End-to-End Tests using Playwright.**
-   Deployment automation.
